              Documentation. In the event of any conflict, inconsistency or
              ambiguity between these terms and conditions and the Sales
              Documentation, these terms and conditions shall prevail. Terms not

              this Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party: (i)
              upon written notice if the other party breaches any material term
              of this Agreement and such breach remains uncorrected for thirty
              (30) days following written notice; or (ii) immediately, if the
              other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary
              petition in bankruptcy or any involuntary proceeding relating to
              insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or similar action for the
              benefit of creditors as a consequence of debt, or if the other
              party otherwise ceases or threatens to cease business. Subject to
              any termination payments specified in the Sales Documentation,
              upon termination of this Agreement, Green IT shall be entitled to
              be paid for all work performed, including fees and expenses, up to

              described in the Sales Documentation in a good and workmanlike

              Customer is responsible for all taxes, customs duties, import fees
              or other similar charges, and all other mandatory payments imposed
              by government entities with respect to the Services and
              Deliverables, excluding tax imposed on Green IT’s net income and
              withholding taxes (subject to the condition of providing
              withholding tax payment receipts, as set forth below). Green IT
              will bill applicable taxes as a separate item on Customer’s
              invoice. If a transaction is exempt from tax, Customer will
              provide Green IT with a valid exemption certificate or other
              evidence of such exemption in a form acceptable to Green IT. If
              Customer is required by law to withhold any tax from the payment,
              Customer will provide to Green IT original or certified copies of
              all tax payment receipts or other evidence of payment of taxes by
              Customer with respect to transactions under this Agreement. If
              Customer fails to provide Green IT with such tax payment receipts,
              if applicable, then Customer will reimburse Green IT for any
              fines, penalties, taxes and other governmental agency charges
              resulting from such failure.

              To the extent that confidential and proprietary information of
              each party (“Confidential Information”) is exchanged and received

              required to maintain the confidentiality of such information as
              required by this Section 5. “Confidential Information” includes
              (but is not limited to) Green IT Information (as defined in
              Section 6(b) below), but does not include: (i) information that

              from carrying on such business. Customer acknowledges that Green
              IT Security may at its sole discretion develop, use, market,
              distribute and license software or documentation that is
              substantially similar to the Deliverables including without
              limitation software with similar structure, sequence and
              organisation as the Deliverables. Notwithstanding the preceding
              sentence, Green IT Security agrees that it will not market or

            <h4>7. Indemnification</h4>
            <p>
              (a) Green IT Security shall defend and indemnify and hold Customer
              harmless from any claim asserting that the Services or
              Deliverables infringe any intellectual property right of any third
              party, and will pay any and all damages awarded by a court and
              actually paid by Customer, or agreed to in settlement by Green
              ITSecurity and attributable to such claim. Green IT Security’s
              obligations under this Section 7 are subject to Customer doing the
              following: (i) providing Green ITSecurity all reasonable
              assistance and information to enable Green IT Security to perform
              its duties under this Section 7; (ii) allowing Green IT Security
              sole control of the defense and all related settlement
              negotiations; and (iii) not having compromised or settled such
              claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may participate at
              Customer’s expense in the defense of any such claim with its own
              counsel, provided Green IT Security retains sole control of the
              suit. Customer has the right to approve any settlement that
              affirmatively places on Customer an obligation that has a material
              adverse effect on Customer other than the obligations to cease
              using the affected Deliverables or to pay sums indemnified
              hereunder. Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. If the
              Services or Deliverables are found to infringe, or if Green IT
              Security determines in its sole opinion that either is likely to
              be found to infringe, then Green IT Security will either: (a)
              obtain for Customer the right to continue to use Deliverable; or
              (b) modify the Services or Deliverable so as to make it
              non-infringing, or replace it with a non-infringing equivalent
              substantially comparable in functionality, in which case Customer
              will stop using any infringing version of the Services or
              Deliverable; or if or if Green IT Security determines in its sole
              opinion that (a) and/or (b) are not commercially reasonable); (c)
              terminate Customer’s rights and Green IT Security’s obligations
              under this Agreement with respect to such Services or Deliverable,
              and refund to Customer the fees paid for the relevant Services or
              Deliverables. Notwithstanding the above, Green IT Security will
              have no liability for any infringement claim based on: (i)
              modification of the Services or Deliverable other than by Green IT
              Security; (ii) combination, use or operation of the Services or
              Deliverable with products not specifically authorized by Green IT
              Security to be combined with the Services or Deliverables; (iii)
              use of Services or Deliverables other than in accordance with this
              Agreement; (iv) Customer’s continued use of infringing Services or
              Deliverables after Green IT Security, for no additional charge,
              supplies or offers to supply modified or replacement
              non-infringing Services or Deliverables.
